# Quick Start Guide

## Software Development Workflow Simulation Ready! 🎉

### What's Set Up

✅ **Python 3.13** virtual environment  
✅ **Jupyter Lab** with full data science stack  
✅ **SimPy** for discrete event simulation  
✅ **Complete workflow simulation** comparing development approaches  

### Start Jupyter Lab

```powershell
# Method 1: Use the PowerShell script
.\start_jupyter.ps1

# Method 2: Manual activation
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
jupyter lab

# Method 3: Direct path
.\venv\Scripts\jupyter.exe lab
```

### Current Server

🌐 **Jupyter Lab is running at:**
http://localhost:8889/lab?token=10851cc20ad8c5a9d003d4f98516f673234c6e0876457050

### Main Notebook

**`workflow_queue_simulation.ipynb`** - Complete software development workflow simulation

### Simulation Scenarios

- **Traditional PR** - Standard pull request workflow with 7 developers
- **AI-Enhanced PR** - PR workflow with AI-assisted development (1.3x speed)  
- **Pair Programming** - Real-time collaborative development with 4 pairs
- **AI-Enhanced Pairs** - Pair programming with AI assistance

### Key Simulation Features

🔄 **Realistic Modeling**: Industry-based defect rates, rework cycles, context switching  
📊 **Comprehensive Analysis**: Lead times, throughput, queue performance, statistical trends  
⚡ **Performance Insights**: AI enhancement effects, pair programming benefits  
🧮 **Queue Theory**: SimPy-based discrete event simulation with resource constraints  

### What You'll Learn

- **Lead Time Impact** - How different workflows affect delivery speed
- **Bottleneck Analysis** - Where queues form and impact performance
- **AI Benefits** - Quantified improvements from AI-assisted development
- **Pair Programming ROI** - Lower defect rates vs. reduced individual productivity
- **Context Switching Costs** - Hidden overhead in traditional workflows

### Next Steps

1. Open Jupyter Lab in your browser
2. Run the `workflow_queue_simulation.ipynb` notebook
3. Analyze the generated charts and statistics
4. Experiment with different parameters
5. Use results for team discussions and process improvements

**Happy simulating! 🚀📊**
