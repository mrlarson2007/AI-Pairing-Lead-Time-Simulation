# Queue Simulation Project Plan

**Date:** July 12, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation Review  

## Project Overview

Software development team workflow simulation comparing:

1. Traditional PR-based workflow (baseline)
2. PR-based workflow with AI assistance
3. Pair programming + trunk-based development
4. Pair programming + trunk-based + AI assistance

Focus: Understanding impact of AI tools and development methodologies on team productivity and workflow bottlenecks.

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goal

Compare the impact of AI adoption and development methodologies on software team productivity and workflow efficiency.

### Key Metrics to Measure

1. **Throughput:** Tickets completed per week across all scenarios
2. **Lead Time:** Average time from ticket start to completion
3. **Cycle Time:** Active work time vs. waiting/queue time
4. **Queue Lengths:** Number of tickets/PRs waiting at any given time

### Scenarios to Compare

1. **Baseline:** Traditional PR workflow (individual work)
2. **AI-Enhanced PR:** Traditional workflow with 30% AI coding speedup
3. **Pair Programming:** Trunk-based development with pairs
4. **AI-Enhanced Pairs:** Pair programming with 30% AI coding speedup

## Requirements

### Baseline Scenario (Traditional PR Workflow)

- **Team size:** 8 developers
- **Work availability:** Infinite backlog - always work available
- **Planning:** Weekly task breakdown sessions
- **Coding time:** 1 day per ticket (dev completes coding and creates PR at end of day)
- **PR review process:**
  - **Daily review rotation:** 1 designated reviewer per day
  - **Review capacity:** 2 hours total per day for all PRs (hard limit)
  - **Capacity constraint:** ~6-8 PRs max per day (15-20 min per PR)
  - **Queue overflow:** PRs exceeding daily capacity wait until next day
  - **Reviewer workflow:** Reviews first, then codes remaining ~6 hours
  - **Two-step cycle:** Initial review ‚Üí feedback ‚Üí developer fixes ‚Üí re-review ‚Üí merge
  - **Total PR time:** Varies based on queue length and capacity constraints
- **Context switching:** Developers stop current work immediately to address PR feedback
- **Workflow:** Individual work ‚Üí PR creation ‚Üí Review queue ‚Üí Review cycles ‚Üí Merge

### Scenario Parameters (To be defined)

### Pair Programming + Trunk-Based Development

- **Team structure:** 4 pairs (8 developers total)
- **Task completion:** Same 1 day per task (no speed advantage over individuals)
- **Concurrency trade-off:** 4 concurrent tasks max (vs 8 for individuals)
- **Quality advantage:** 40% reduction in defects/rework compared to individuals
- **Workflow:** Pairs commit directly to trunk/main
- **Automated feedback:** Immediate processing after commits during business hours
- **Break-fix priority:** Pairs stop current work immediately when build/tests break
- **Rework response:** Fix issues as soon as they're detected (no batching)
- **Weekend handling:** No automated feedback processing on weekends

### AI Enhancement Parameters

- **Coding speedup:** 30% faster for both initial coding and rework/bug fixing
- **Quality impact:** No change in defect rates (developers become too trusting of AI)
- **Application:** Applies to all development scenarios (individual work, pair work)
- **Scope:** Speed improvement only - quality effects come from pair programming
- **Combination:** AI speed benefits stack with pair programming quality benefits
